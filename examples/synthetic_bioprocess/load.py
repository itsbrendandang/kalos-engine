"""One-call loader for the synthetic bioprocess fixture.

`kalos/bench` otherwise has only abstract math surfaces (`objectives.py`) -
its pool benchmark (`kalos.bench.pool.pool_from_frame`) needs a real run
sheet, and the real pool benchmarks all require client data that cannot be
committed. This fixture is the non-proprietary stand-in: 160 seeded rows of a
synthetic bioprocess with a known optimum, so `kalos.bench.pool` has
something to run in CI and in a fresh clone with zero setup.

`load_frame()` is a plain `pd.read_csv`. `load_pool()` is the one call this
module exists for: it hands `pool_from_frame` the frame and the known target
column name, returning `(X, y, feature_names)` ready for
`kalos.bench.pool.run_pool_one` (or any other pool-benchmark entry point)
with no further wiring.
