"""Generate a synthetic bioprocess dataset to test the drop-and-run flow.

Ported verbatim from an earlier engine repo
(samples/make_synthetic.py) into kalos as a non-proprietary benchmark fixture.
Every number here is generated from a fixed seed, not measured - there is no
client or proprietary data anywhere in this file or the CSV it writes, so
both are safe to commit.

Known structure (so the engine has real, recoverable signal):
- continuous process inputs (pH, temp, feeds, DO, ...) sampled by Latin Hypercube;
- a smooth titer response with a true optimum (Gaussian bumps + saturation);
- a feasibility gate: out-of-band conditions kill the culture -> titer = 0
  (~30% non-producers), so the feasibility model has negatives to learn;
- plus an id column and a categorical, to check the brain skips non-features.

Seeded -> reproducible. This is a TEST fixture for the pipeline mechanics, not
training data for a real model (synthetic outcomes must never stand in for
measured ones).

Run:  python examples/synthetic_bioprocess/make_synthetic.py
      -> examples/synthetic_bioprocess/synthetic_bioprocess.csv
