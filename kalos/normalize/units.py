"""Canonical unit registry + messy-cell parsing for bioprocess run sheets.

Client run sheets encode units in the cell text ("34.6 C", "88%", "0.45 mL/h")
rather than in a separate column, so a single "titer" column can silently mix
g/L and mg/mL across rows. This module is the one place that knows how to pull
a `(value, unit_token)` pair out of a messy cell and how to convert that value
into a fixed BASE unit per dimension, so every canonical column downstream is
in one unit, always.

Base units and conversion formulas (the single source of truth - do not
duplicate these elsewhere):
  temperature   -> base Celsius (C)
    F -> (v - 32) * 5 / 9
    K -> v - 273.15
    C -> v
  percent       -> base is the bare percent number (unit-less, 0-100 scale)
    % / pct -> v unchanged
  concentration -> base g/L
    g/L, g/l  -> v
    mg/mL, mg/ml -> v            (1 mg/mL == 1 g/L, since mg/mL = g/L numerically)
  flow rate     -> base mL/h
    mL/h, ml/h -> v
    uL/h, µL/h -> v / 1000       (ascii "u" and the micro sign both accepted)
    L/h        -> v * 1000
    mL/min     -> v * 60         (per-minute gas/liquid flow, e.g. sparge air)
    L/min      -> v * 60000
  time          -> base hours (h)
    h, hr -> v
    min   -> v / 60
  agitation     -> base rpm
    rpm -> v
  pressure      -> base bar
    bar -> v
  mass          -> base grams (g)
    g  -> v
    kg -> v * 1000
  dimensionless -> no unit at all (pH, OD): value passes through unchanged,
    canonical suffix is the empty string.

NOTE on what is deliberately NOT a recognized unit: bare "L"/"mL" (volume) is
NOT in the registry, on purpose. Bioprocess run sheets commonly use "L" as a
VESSEL-SIZE IDENTIFIER, not a measurement - "5L", "500L" (bioreactor scale
labels), not "5 liters of something". Recognizing "L" as a unit would
silently convert that identifier into a numeric measurement (stripping the
label and keeping the bare number) - `is_known_unit`'s docstring below and
`tests/test_validation_gate.py::test_unrecognized_unit_is_not_silently_converted`
both encode this as a deliberate, tested exclusion. Do not add it back
without addressing that collision first (e.g. requiring a compound token
like "L/well" that a vessel-size label would never produce).

Every unit token maps to a `(dimension, to_base_fn, canonical_suffix)` triple
in `_UNIT_TABLE`. This keeps the registry a small, readable, data-driven table
instead of a pile of if/elif chains: adding a unit means adding one row.
