"""Deterministic run-sheet normalization: units, canonical names, and a plan.

Import-light by design (stdlib + `re` + `pandas` + the anonymizer's identity
rules only) - this package must stay usable anywhere `kalos.kit` is, without
ever pulling in torch/botorch/gpytorch. No top-level import of `anthropic` or
`pydantic` happens here either (see `llm.py`) - those are lazy-imported only
inside the live LLM call, so this package stays usable without the
`normalize` extra installed. `offline_plan`/`propose_plan`'s offline fallback
never touches the network; the live LLM path only activates when
`credentials_available()` is true, and always falls back to the offline path
on any failure.
