"""Tier-1 orientation pre-pass: detect whether an uploaded run sheet is in
standard orientation (rows = runs/experiments, columns = parameters) or
transposed (rows = parameters, columns = runs/experiments), and normalize a
confidently-transposed sheet back to standard orientation.

This has to run BEFORE unit normalization or the validation gate can mean
anything - a rule checking "is this column numeric" is meaningless if the
column is actually a row of parameter labels because the sheet came in
transposed (see `docs/ingestion-architecture.md` in the kalos-transition
repo, "Tier 1: deterministic pre-passes"). Fully deterministic - no LLM
call is ever appropriate here, and this module never raises on data: a
confused heuristic degrades to "ambiguous, leave it alone", never to a
crash or a silent guess.

Provenance: adapted from `ports/csv-orientation/csv_adapter.py`
(`CSVAdapter.detect_format` / `_process_transposed_format`) in the
itsbrendandang/kalos-transition repo, itself ported near-verbatim from
`itsbrendandang/voyPlot-main` @ `722e5520944535c20b5ccfc4e75729359cedabf6`
(see that port's own PROVENANCE.md for the client-identifier scrub log on
`BIOPROCESS_KEYWORDS`, kept unchanged below - already generic). Adapted
here into kalos house style: a typed `OrientationReport` dataclass, a
three-way standard/transposed/AMBIGUOUS decision (the source used a bare
`score > 3` boolean), and defensive `try/except` wrapping so this function
can never raise on malformed input - the source's `detect_format` had no
such guard. The source's objective/target-row detection was NOT ported:
target/feature role assignment is `kalos.normalize.synonyms.guess_role`'s
job, not this pre-pass's.
