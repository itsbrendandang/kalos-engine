"""A normalization plan: per-column decisions (rename/convert/hash/drop) plus
the provenance of what actually happened when the plan was applied.

A `NormalizationPlan` is the thing an LLM (or the offline fallback in
`synonyms.guess_role`) proposes; `apply.apply_plan` is the thing that actually
executes it deterministically against a dataframe. Keeping the plan as its own
serializable object means the same plan can be inspected, edited, and re-run,
and a client audit can always answer "why does column X look like this" from
committed JSON, not from re-running an LLM.
