"""GP surrogate on BoTorch.

A `SingleTaskGP` with input normalization and output standardization — the
production-grade replacement for the lean hand-rolled GP. Fits by exact marginal
likelihood and returns a posterior mean + standard deviation in the target's
original units.

Device note: BoTorch GPs run in float64 for numerical stability, and Apple's MPS
backend does not support float64, so the GP runs on CPU. This is the right call
for the small-sample regime BO targets anyway (GP fits on ~100 rows are fast on
CPU). The deep-learning protein embedder runs on MPS separately.
