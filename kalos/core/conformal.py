"""Split-conformal prediction intervals — distribution-free coverage.

Ported from the lean engine. Calibrate on a held-out set's absolute residuals to
get a half-width q such that [mu - q, mu + q] covers at least (1 - alpha) of
outcomes, with NO assumption about the error distribution (valid even when titer
residuals are skewed or heteroscedastic). Pairs naturally with the BoTorch
surrogate: pass `surrogate.posterior(X)[0]` (the mean) as the prediction.
