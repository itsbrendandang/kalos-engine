"""Strip client identity from run metadata.

Ported from the lean engine's data_moat/anonymize.py. One job: drop the columns
that name a client (client/strain/operator) and replace grouping ids
(campaign/lot/batch) with an irreversible salted hash, so a run can still be
grouped for leakage-safe CV without carrying who it belongs to.

The barcode-minting half of this module was removed along with
`kalos.data.barcode_registry`: barcoding is explicitly off the roadmap, and the
minting helpers had no caller left once the registry went.
