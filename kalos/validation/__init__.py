"""Bioprocess data-validation gate: a pre-flight quality check on a run sheet.

A client upload can be wrong in ways that are perfectly numeric and will
still fit a model without complaint: a titer column silently mixing g/L and
mg/mL, a pH of 40, a five-row sheet, an OD column that is 95% blank. None of
that trips a `pd.to_numeric` coercion or a shape check - the model just
learns from bad data and produces a confident, wrong recommendation. This
package is the layer that looks for exactly those failure modes before a
run sheet reaches the engine.

`validate_frame` is the entry point: run all eleven checks, aggregate their
findings into one `ValidationReport`, and never raise (a validation gate
that crashes on the data it exists to catch is worse than no gate at all).
`report.py` defines the report's shape, `bounds.py` the physically-possible
ranges checks compare against, `checks.py` the eleven checks themselves.

Torch-free by contract (numpy/pandas/scipy only), matching the rest of the
domain-neutral layer this package sits alongside.
