"""Physically-possible-range registry for bioprocess measurement columns.

A run sheet's numeric columns are not free-form: "pH" cannot be 40 and a
titer cannot be negative, regardless of what a client's export script wrote
into the cell. This module is a small, data-driven table mapping a
measurement DIMENSION (ph, temperature_c, ...) to two nested ranges:

  - HARD range: values outside it are physically impossible for that
    dimension, full stop (a negative concentration, a pH above 14). A
    violation is a data bug, not a surprising-but-real measurement, so
    `checks.check_physical_bounds` reports it as an ERROR.
  - TYPICAL range: the inner band a value is expected to fall in during a
    normal bioprocess run. A value outside TYPICAL but still inside HARD is
    physically possible but operationally suspicious (pH 2.5 in a mammalian
    culture, a 5 C incubation) - worth a human's attention, so it is a
    WARNING, not an ERROR.

`DIMENSION_BOUNDS` is intentionally small and every number below is
justified in its own comment. Where a bound is a physical law (0-14 for pH,
non-negative concentration) that is stated. Where a bound is a convention or
heuristic chosen for lack of a sharper physical constraint, that is stated
too - this table does not manufacture false precision.

Column -> dimension inference is by header regex (`infer_dimension`), not by
looking at the data. A column whose header does not match any known pattern
gets no dimension and therefore no bounds check: silence, not a guess.

Base units for the "unbounded above" dimensions match `kalos.normalize.units`
exactly (concentration -> g/L, flow_rate -> mL/h, time -> hours) so
`checks.check_physical_bounds` can convert every cell to its base unit via
`units.convert` before comparing against these ranges - a Fahrenheit reading
must never be compared against a Celsius bound.
