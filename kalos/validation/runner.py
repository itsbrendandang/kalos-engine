"""The validation gate's entry point: run all nine checks, never raise.

`validate_frame` is meant to sit in front of the analyze/optimize path and
look at exactly the kind of data that path is most likely to choke on -
mixed units, impossible values, duplicate rows, a five-row upload. A
validation gate that itself crashes on that input is worse than useless: it
turns a data-quality problem the client could have fixed into an opaque
500. So every check runs inside its own try/except here; one bad column or
an unexpected shape in one check can only ever cost that check's findings,
never take down the report.

`mode` ("warn" vs., say, a future "block") is carried through to the report
untouched. The runner does not read it or change behavior based on it - that
decision belongs to the caller (the portal route), which can choose to
reject a `status == "fail"` upload when in a stricter mode. Keeping that
choice out of this module keeps it a pure "what did we find," not a policy
engine.
