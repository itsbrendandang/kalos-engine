"""Typed result shapes for the data-validation gate.

A validation run over a client run sheet can turn up anywhere from zero to
thousands of findings (a 100k-row sheet with one bad column can trigger one
finding PER offending row if nothing caps it). This module is the one place
that owns the shape of that result so:

  - `status` is always derived from the findings, never handed in by a check
    or the runner - a check cannot accidentally report "pass" while also
    emitting an error finding, because there is no constructor path that lets
    the two disagree (see `build_report`).
  - `rows` on a `Finding` is capped at the first 20 offending row indices, with
    the true count recorded in `detail["n_rows_affected"]`. A report is meant
    to be read by a human or rendered in a UI; it must stay small even when
    the underlying data problem is large.
  - every row index is a plain Python `int`, never a numpy scalar, so
    `report_dict(...)` is always `json.dumps`-safe without a custom encoder.

Nothing in here inspects a dataframe - that is `checks.py`'s job. This module
only defines the vocabulary the checks and the runner speak.

    exactly what `inf` meant here. NaN maps to None for the same reason - there
