"""Kalos portal — visualization payloads for the dashboard.

These are torch-free helpers that compute PCA, Spearman correlation, and a
bounded response surface from the fitted GP. They are called inside `_analyze`
while the GP is still alive, then discarded — no serialization, no persistence.

All visualizations use the `null-with-reason` pattern:
  - When available: the data structure + reason=null
  - When unavailable: None + a reason is logged (caller picks it up)
This matches the existing `cv_logo` / `alternative_scale` pattern.
