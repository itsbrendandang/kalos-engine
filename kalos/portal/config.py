"""Kalos portal - deployment security configuration (docs/HARDENING.md, Phase 1c).

Centralizes the security-relevant configuration read from the environment so the
running posture is explicit, testable, and logged once at startup rather than
scattered across the app. Today that is the CORS origin policy; secrets (auth
tokens) are read in `kalos.portal.auth`.

Backward compatible: with nothing configured the portal keeps its permissive
localhost CORS (dev/pilot). Setting `KALOS_CORS_ORIGINS` switches to an explicit
allowlist - the production posture - so a browser page on some other origin can
no longer make credentialed calls to the engine.

    Two things block startup on a non-loopback bind, and they were chosen on one
    principle: BLOCK THE SILENT FAILURES, WARN ON THE LOUD ONES.

      - Authentication not enforced. Silent: the portal serves happily and nothing
        tells the operator that every caller is getting anonymous read+write.
      - `KALOS_ANON_SALT` unset. Silent: pseudonyms are emitted successfully and
        look fine, while being derived from a published dev salt and therefore
        dictionary-attackable by anyone who reads this source. The whole purpose of
        the salt is that these hashes leave the machine.

    `KALOS_CORS_ORIGINS` deliberately does NOT block. It is worth being precise
    about why, because "permissive CORS" oversells it: the default is
    `allow_origin_regex` restricted to `http://localhost` and `http://127.0.0.1`,
    with `allow_credentials` off. It rejects `evil.com`, `localhost.evil.com` and
    even `https://localhost`, and with credentials disabled a third-party page
    cannot ride a user's token. So it is not a credential-theft vector. What it
    does do on a real deployment is block the legitimate browser client at, say,
    `https://app.acme.com` - a failure that announces itself in the first request
    anyone makes, which is exactly the kind that does not need a startup refusal.
    It gets a specific warning instead.

    Loopback binds are untouched, so `python -m kalos.portal` and local
    development keep working exactly as before.

    With no tokens provisioned the API grants an anonymous read+write principal on
    the `default` tenant, so binding it to a non-loopback interface publishes
    upload, analysis and campaign mutation to anyone who can route to the host.
    That posture was previously guarded only by a startup WARNING, which is the
    kind of thing nobody reads until afterwards.

    Loopback binds are untouched, so `python -m kalos.portal` and local
    development keep working exactly as before. Set `KALOS_AUTH_TOKENS[_FILE]` to
    fix it properly, or `KALOS_ALLOW_OPEN_ACCESS=1` to accept the risk knowingly.
