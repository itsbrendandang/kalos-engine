"""python -m kalos.portal  ->  serve the portal, loopback-only by default.

Host and port come from `KALOS_HOST` / `KALOS_PORT` and default to
`127.0.0.1:8050`. They were previously hardcoded, which made this entrypoint
accidentally safe: nobody could expose the portal without editing the source.
Making them configurable is what a real deployment needs, so the bind is now
checked instead of merely being impossible.

Serving unauthenticated on a non-loopback interface fails fast with an actionable
message rather than starting and hoping the operator reads a warning. See
`kalos.portal.config.assert_safe_bind`. The peer-address guard in
`kalos.portal.app` covers the case where uvicorn is launched directly and this
check never runs at all.
