"""Ingestion preflight + per-column provenance for the /api/run analyze path.

A client uploads an arbitrary run sheet and the engine silently keeps some
columns as features, treats one as the target, and drops the rest (ids, other
measured outputs, constants, sparse columns). That silent drop is a
product-readiness hole: the client cannot see what the model actually used.

`column_provenance` reproduces the exact feature-selection decisions made in
`kalos.portal.app._analyze` and returns a typed, per-column report so the UI can
show, for every column, whether it was kept, why it was dropped, and how many of
its cells had to be coerced from non-numeric text (units like "34.6 C", "88 %").

This module is pure and side-effect free: it inspects a dataframe and the same
regexes/thresholds `_analyze` uses, and never logs raw column names or values.

    Parameters map to the exact objects `_analyze` computes so this report can
    never disagree with what the model actually used:
      - `target`: the chosen target column name.
      - `features`: the columns kept as model inputs.
      - `numeric_cols`: columns that passed the >=80% numeric-parse test.
      - `is_identifier` / `outcome_hint`: the predicate `_analyze` uses to drop
        identifier-like columns (`analysis.is_identifier_name`) and the compiled
        regex for output-like columns.
      - `constant_on_fitted_rows`: columns that vary over the full sheet but are
        constant on the target-present rows the GP actually fits, so their design
        box would collapse to zero width. `_analyze` drops these; they are flagged
        here (not silently pinned) so the client is not misled about that column.
      - `declared_ids`: columns the caller explicitly declared as ids to ignore,
        so they are reported as `dropped_id` (source `declared`) rather than
        mislabeled `dropped_sparse` by the generic non-numeric branch.
      - `declared_features`: columns the caller declared as features; if such a
        column is non-numeric (and not a categorical the engine used) it is
        reported as `dropped_non_numeric` - an honest "you likely meant to mark
        this categorical" - rather than the misleading `dropped_sparse`.
