"""Kalos portal — the campaign store: one closed optimization loop.

See docs/CAMPAIGN_LOOP.md for the full contract this module implements. A
*campaign* is one optimization target plus a growing base dataset
(`base_rows`) and a list of `pending` runs — recipes started from a proposed
batch, each either *awaiting* a measured outcome (`result: null`) or
*measured* (`result` filled), waiting to be folded into `base_rows` on the
next re-analyze.

Deliberately kept torch-free: this module only persists data. `_analyze`
(`kalos.portal.analysis`) is the science; `kalos.portal.campaign_routes`
calls it, not this store, so importing `kalos.portal.campaign` never pays the
torch/botorch import tax and the store stays trivially unit-testable.

Persistence is a SQLite table `campaigns(tenant, state, updated_at)` in
`<KALOS_STATE_DIR>/portal.db` (default `~/.kalos`), **one row per tenant**
(docs/HARDENING.md, Phase 1b). Every method takes a `tenant` (defaulting to
`"default"`, the open-mode tenant), so two tenants can never see or overwrite
each other's campaign. A single lock serializes read-modify-write cycles, and
each write runs in a SQLite transaction, so a reader never observes a partial
state. The generation-token check that makes re-analyze transactional is
unchanged — it lives inside the per-tenant `state` blob.
