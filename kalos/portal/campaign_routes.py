"""Kalos portal — `/api/campaign*`: the closed optimization loop (M3,
docs/CAMPAIGN_LOOP.md). Thin wrappers over `kalos.portal.campaign.CampaignStore`,
mirroring the router pattern in `kalos.portal.experiments`.

Auth posture: the mutating endpoints (`start`, `result`, `reanalyze`) require
the `write` scope via `kalos.portal.auth` (docs/HARDENING.md, Phase 1). In open
mode (no tokens configured) the anonymous principal holds read+write, so the
local dev/pilot loop is unchanged; once tokens are provisioned these endpoints
enforce them. `GET /api/campaign` stays open for now (read gating is a
follow-up). Per-tenant isolation of the campaign store is the next slice.

    `/api/latest` — the loop closing (docs/CAMPAIGN_LOOP.md, "Re-analyze =
    the loop closing").

    Transactional: the fold is committed to `campaign.json` only after
    `_analyze` succeeds, and only if the campaign's `generation` is unchanged
    (`plan_fold` → `_analyze` → `commit_fold`). A failed analysis or a
    concurrent upload that reseeds mid-analysis leaves `campaign.json`
    untouched and returns a retry (409).

    `/api/latest` is a SEPARATE resource (`_LATEST`, its own lock) with no
    shared transaction, so its final write can only be guarded best-effort:
    after committing, this re-checks the campaign generation right before
    `_save_latest` and skips the write if a fresh upload reseeded in the
    meantime (its own `_save_latest` already wrote the newer analysis). This
    eliminates the multi-second race across `_analyze` and closes the
    upload-lands-after-commit case; a sub-millisecond window between the
    re-check and `_save_latest` remains (fully sealing it would need an
    ordered generation stamp on `_LATEST` itself — see docs/CAMPAIGN_LOOP.md).

    `_analyze`/`_save_latest` are imported from `kalos.portal.app` INSIDE
    this function, not at module load: `app.py` imports and mounts this
    router, so a module-level import here would be circular. `_analyze` is
    CPU-bound (a GP fit + acquisition optimization), so it runs via
    `run_in_threadpool`, matching how `/api/run` offloads it in `app.py`.
