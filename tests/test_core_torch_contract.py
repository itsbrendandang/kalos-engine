"""Guard: `kalos.core` modules stay torch-free unless explicitly allowlisted.

`kalos.core.__init__` documents that the package is torch-free except for
`surrogate.py`, `optimize.py`, and `multiobjective.py` - the three modules
that actually define the GP surrogate / acquisition machinery and therefore
need torch/botorch/gpytorch at import time. Everything else must defer any
such import to inside a function body, because `import kalos.core` (which
every sibling submodule runs first) must not drag in the ~220 MB torch/
botorch/gpytorch RSS before a fit is ever requested - that is what keeps the
idle `--watch` poller and portal boot cheap.

This is a static check, not a runtime one (contrast `test_kit_torch_free.py`,
which asserts `kalos.kit` does not load torch as a *runtime* side effect of
import, in a subprocess). Parsing with `ast` instead of grepping means a
string that merely mentions "torch" in a docstring or comment does not trip
this test, and an import nested inside a function body - the exact pattern
that keeps a module's callers lazy - correctly does NOT count as top-level,
because it never appears in `ast.Module.body`.
