"""An unauthenticated portal must not serve callers off the box.

With no tokens provisioned every request resolves to an anonymous read+write
principal on the `default` tenant (`kalos.portal.auth`). Binding that to a
non-loopback interface publishes upload, analysis and campaign mutation to anyone
who can route to the host, and until now the only guard was a startup WARNING.

Two layers, because either alone is insufficient:

  - `assert_safe_exposure`, called from `python -m kalos.portal`, fails fast with an
    actionable message. It is bypassed entirely by `uvicorn kalos.portal.app:app
    --host 0.0.0.0`, which is what a real deployment does.
  - a peer-address guard in the app, which cannot be bypassed by choosing a
    different entrypoint, because it keys off who is actually calling.

Local development is deliberately untouched: loopback callers are always served,
so open mode still works on a bench machine and across this test suite.
