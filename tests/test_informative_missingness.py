"""Tests for `check_informative_missingness` (MNAR: missingness vs. the target).

`check_missingness` already reports HOW blank a column or row is. This check
asks a different question: whether blankness itself correlates with the
outcome, the failure mode documented on a real clone-funnel
data (earlier engine docs/ml-review.md, finding P0.1) where per-row
missing-fraction vs. titer had Spearman rho = -0.835 - "no measurement" was
the human culling decision, not benign absence, and zero-filling before a GP
fit would have quietly encoded that decision into the features.

Every fixture here is hand-built (no RNG) so the exact rho and n are known in
advance and the tests are fully deterministic.
