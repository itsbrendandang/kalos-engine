"""`propose` reproducibility is the caller's job today - `seed` is an opt-in escape hatch.

`kalos.core.optimize.propose` and `kalos.core.multiobjective.propose_multiobjective`
are stochastic: multi-start acquisition optimization for both, plus the qLogNEHVI
Sobol sampler for the multi-objective path. Reproducibility has always come from
the CALLER seeding the global torch RNG before calling - the portal's
`_seeded_analysis` and the bench harness both do this today. A library consumer
that imports `kalos.core.optimize` directly and never seeds the global RNG gets
silently non-reproducible proposals under that contract, with no way to opt out.

`seed` closes that gap without changing the contract for existing callers: `None`
(the default) seeds nothing, so behavior is byte-identical to before this
parameter existed. A given `seed` is applied inside `torch.random.fork_rng()`, so
a seeded call is reproducible on its own AND does not clobber the caller's global
RNG state as a side effect - a library function silently resetting its caller's
RNG state on every call would be a new bug, not a fix for the one this closes.
