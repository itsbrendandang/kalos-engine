"""Tests for the non-proprietary synthetic bioprocess fixture (`examples/synthetic_bioprocess`).

`kalos/bench` otherwise has only abstract math surfaces (`objectives.py`); its
pool benchmark (`kalos.bench.pool.pool_from_frame`) needs a real run sheet,
and the real ones all require client data that cannot be committed. This
fixture - ported from an earlier engine repo
(samples/synthetic_bioprocess.csv + make_synthetic.py) - is the non-proprietary
stand-in: fully synthetic, seeded, safe to commit.

These tests check the fixture itself, not the engine: the CSV has the shape
and columns the docs promise, the feasibility gate zeroes the documented
fraction of rows, and a FAST classifier (cross-validated RandomForest, no GP
fit) recovers the known feasibility signal well above chance - confirming the
signal is real and strong, the way `samples/README.md` originally documented
it (AUC ~ 0.97 there). Everything here runs in well under a second; no GP
touches this file, keeping the whole thing comfortably inside ~15s.
