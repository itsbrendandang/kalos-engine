"""Guard: `kalos.kit` must stay importable without ever loading torch.

`kalos.kit` is the torch-free facade a sibling repo (the earlier engine,
deliberately torch-free) is meant to import instead of keeping its own copies
of these primitives. torch IS installed in this venv (it is a normal test
dependency via the `ml` extra), so the check below runs in a fresh
subprocess and asserts torch is not LOADED as a side effect of the import -
that is the actual contract, and it must hold regardless of what other tests
in this suite have already imported into the current process.
