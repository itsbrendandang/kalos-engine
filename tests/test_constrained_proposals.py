"""PART 2 of the #1 backlog item: constrained single-objective proposals -
maximize the target subject to a second fitted outcome clearing a floor
(e.g. `purity_pct >= 95.0`).

Mechanism: `kalos.core.optimize.propose`'s `constraint_surrogate` +
`constraint_floor` arguments compose the target and constraint `Surrogate`s
into a `ModelListGP` and hand BoTorch's NATIVE `constraints=` argument on
`qLogNoisyExpectedImprovement` a callable satisfied where
`constraint_floor - constraint_value <= 0`.

Policy: `kalos.portal.analysis._analyze`'s `constraint` parameter decides
WHETHER that mechanism gets used on a given upload - column present, enough
rows, the constraint model actually fits - reported honestly and falling back
to an unconstrained proposal (never crashing) when it cannot be applied.
