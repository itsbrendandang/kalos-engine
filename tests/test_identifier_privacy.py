"""Identifier columns must not be modeled, and must not escape anonymization.

Both failures below were live, and both trace to the same root cause: a
`DomainProfile.id_hint` anchored to whole tokens (`^(id|name|run|batch|campaign|
lot|...)$`) matches a column called exactly `run`, but not `run_number`,
`batch_id`, `campaign_id` or `lot_number`. Real run sheets use the compound
forms, so identifier columns were sailing straight past every check keyed on
that pattern.

1. SCIENTIFIC. A numeric identifier became a model FEATURE. Given `run_number`
   and `batch_id`, the engine fit on them, reported both as significant drivers
   at rho = 1.0, and proposed a recipe instructing the scientist to "set
   batch_id = 100.037". A run index rises monotonically with time, so it
   correlates with any drift or learning trend in a campaign and will almost
   always rank as a top driver - a spurious correlation presented as process
   insight.

2. PRIVACY. `anonymize=True` published those same names verbatim while claiming
   to pseudonymize identifier columns, including inside the validation report's
   prose. The codebase already contradicted itself: the metadata scrubber's
   `HASH_EXACT` lists `campaign_id`, so one id was hashed as metadata and
   published as a column name in the same response.
