"""One definition of "same recipe", and it is not the zero-filled matrix.

`_analyze` keeps two frames: `Xc_raw` with NaN preserved, and `Xc_zf` with blanks
filled to 0.0 for the GP and the design box. The CV grouper deliberately runs on
the RAW frame, with a comment saying why - rows missing different components must
not be merged into one group by the zero-fill.

The replicate machinery did not get that treatment. `noise_report` and
`aggregate_replicates` were handed the zero-filled `X` and identified replicates
by comparing rounded feature vectors, so a component that was BLANK looked
identical to a component genuinely dosed at zero. On a sparse media sheet - which
is what a media DoE is, since most formulations omit most candidate components -
distinct recipes were merged into one replicate group. That fabricates
within-recipe variance, which inflates the estimated assay-noise floor and
deflates the reported ICC.

That matters beyond a wrong field: `BENCHMARK.md` reasons from ICC ~= 0.26 to the
conclusion that assay noise, not the optimizer, is the limiting factor. An
inflated noise floor is exactly the artifact that would manufacture that number.

The fix threads an explicit recipe key, built from the raw frame, into both
functions. Note the key is kept SEPARATE from the CV group: a declared group
column is a leakage barrier and is deliberately coarser than a recipe (every run
on one medium lot shares a fold, but those runs are not replicates of each other),
so reusing it as a recipe key would collapse different recipes and reintroduce the
same fabricated variance from the other direction.
