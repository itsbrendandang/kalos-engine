sheet has replicated recipes it proposes on the reproducible (replicate-averaged)
titer with the measured assay noise floor fed to the GP - the "SNR lever" that
BENCHMARK.md shows is what actually makes BO beat random on real, noisy data -
and reports an honest `noise` block. Non-replicated sheets are unchanged.
