# Kalos

A Bayesian-optimization platform for bioprocess development, built on **BoTorch**
(a real GP surrogate + acquisition) with **NVIDIA BioNeMo / ESM-2** protein
features. Honest by construction: leakage-controlled cross-validation and
fail-closed promotion gates, on a production BoTorch core rather than a
hand-rolled GP + EI.

> Genuine, classical/probabilistic + deep-learning ML — not marketing. The BO
> loop runs here today, and ESM-2 embeds protein sequences on the Mac's GPU.

```

A lot of the honest-evaluation and data machinery was carried over from a prior
lean engine (`voyager-brain-rebuild`): the leakage-controlled splits, the
bootstrap-Spearman drivers, the data anonymization, and the push-feed ingestion.

## Anonymized uploads

Client/strain identity can be stripped and grouping keys hashed on upload via the
anonymizer (`kalos/data/anonymizer.py`, `anonymize=true` on `POST /api/run`), so a
run stays groupable for leakage-safe CV without carrying who it belongs to.

## The campaign loop (`/api/campaign*`)

The closed optimization loop behind the kalos-web `/decide` surface: propose a
batch, run the recipes, log the measured outcome, re-propose on the grown
dataset. A campaign is one target plus a growing dataset of (recipe -> measured
outcome) rows; `POST /api/campaign/reanalyze` folds logged results into that
dataset and re-runs the same leakage-controlled `_analyze`, so each round stays
as honest as the first (grouped-CV reliability, conformal bands, "not modeled"
callouts).

Runs that were started but have not been measured yet are handed to the
acquisition as in-flight points (`X_pending`). They have no outcome, so they
never join the fit; but without them a mid-round re-proposal treats a recipe
currently in the incubator as unexplored and proposes it again. On a 4-factor
design at `q=5` over 10 seeds, a blind re-proposal repeated a mean of 2.1 of its
5 recipes against work already running; with the pending block it repeats none
(`python -m kalos.bench --pending`). See `docs/CAMPAIGN_LOOP.md` for the full
contract.

## Uploading a run sheet (`POST /api/run`)

The portal accepts an uploaded CSV / TSV / Excel run sheet and returns the analysis
(auto-detected target, leakage-safe features, honest grouped-CV, signed drivers, a proposed next
batch). Because the sheet comes from an external client, the upload path is guarded:

- **Size + shape caps.** A raw-byte cap (default 25 MB, override with `KALOS_MAX_UPLOAD_MB`), a
  512-column ceiling, a 100k-row CSV cap, and a 2M-cell xlsx cap (a zip-bomb guard). Every cap
  fails closed: an over-cap upload is REJECTED with a 400, never silently truncated. The xlsx
  cell cap is enforced from the workbook's declared dimensions BEFORE the frame is materialized,
  so a zip-bomb is rejected without the memory spike. Filetype is sniffed by magic bytes
  (`PK\x03\x04` -> Excel, else text/CSV), not by extension.
- **Safe errors.** A bad upload returns a generic HTTP 400 ("Could not parse the uploaded file.
  Check it is a CSV or Excel run-sheet."). This holds even when the failure is a GP fit error
  (`torch.linalg.LinAlgError`) or a leakage-guard assertion, not just a parser error: a catch-all
  normalizes any such failure to the same `{error}` JSON envelope. Parser details, column names,
  cell values, paths, and stack traces are logged server-side and never returned to the caller.
- **Provenance.** The response includes a `provenance` list: for every column, its status
  (`kept_feature`, `target`, `dropped_id`, `dropped_output`, `dropped_constant`,
  `dropped_constant_on_fitted_rows`, `dropped_sparse`, `dropped_all_blank`) and how many cells had
  to be coerced from non-numeric text (units like "34.6 C"). A feature that varies over the full
  sheet but is constant on the target-present rows the GP actually fits is dropped and flagged
  (`dropped_constant_on_fitted_rows`), never silently pinned to a zero-width bound. No more silent
  column drops.
- **Data validation gate.** Before any column is typed or dropped, the sheet runs through
  `kalos.validation`: nine checks covering unit consistency, physical bounds, duplicates vs
  replicates, missingness, outliers, provenance metadata, replicate adequacy, controls presence,
  and constant columns. The report is returned as `validation`, with `status` one of `pass`,
  `pass_with_warnings`, or `fail`. An **error** is a physics violation (pH 40, a negative titer, one
  column mixing g/L and mg/mL); a **warning** is possible but operationally suspect. Row lists are
  capped at 20 with the true total in `detail.n_rows_affected`, so a finding never implies its list
  is complete. `KALOS_VALIDATION_MODE=strict` refuses a `fail` upload; the default `warn` analyzes
  it anyway and returns the findings, so adding the gate did not change what the API accepts.
- **Units are converted, not discarded.** A column written `"34.6 C"` parses at 0% as a bare number,
  so it used to fail the >=80% numeric test and come back `dropped_sparse` - a real process input
  silently thrown away. Single-unit columns are now converted to their base unit before feature
  selection and reported in `validation.conversions` with a human label (`"Celsius"`). Only units the
  registry can actually convert are rewritten: a vessel column of `"5L"`/`"500L"` uses an
  unrecognized token, and rewriting it would turn an identifier into a measurement, so it is left
  alone and the client is told.
- **Proposals stay physically possible.** The design box for each continuous feature is built from
  physically valid observations only, so one `-999` sensor sentinel can no longer widen the search
  space into impossible recipes (it previously produced proposals at -422 C, below absolute zero).
  Any narrowing is reported in `design_box_exclusions`, never silent. This holds in every validation
  mode - it does not depend on the client reading the report.
- **Reproducibility.** The analyze path is seeded, so the same upload yields identical proposals;
  the response carries `seed`, `timestamp`, and `engine_version`. Protein embeddings pin the ESM-2
  checkpoint to an immutable commit, so upstream cannot change model features without a diff here.
- **Opt-in anonymization.** Pass the form field `anonymize=true` to pseudonymize identifier-type
  columns in the response. Feature and target names are kept as-is (the owner UI legitimately shows
  drivers like "Methanol").

## The Scale-Up Readout (`POST /api/scale/readout`)

Upload a multi-scale run sheet and a target scale; get back one printable page that either issues a
predicted level at the target scale with an approximate-coverage interval, or refuses and says why.
Before it predicts, kalos backtests itself on your own scale ladder (fit on the smaller scales,
predict the next one up) and only issues a number when that backtest beats two naive baselines and
the requested step up is within 2x of a step it has already won (warning up to 5x, refusal beyond).
Nothing is stored server-side; the page prints the SHA-256 of the upload, the engine version, every
threshold, and the full normalize plan. It predicts a level, not a ranking of recipes at scale.
Development decision support only; not a GMP or regulatory record. Contract, gate checks and the
decision table: `docs/SCALE_READOUT.md`. The evidence behind the scale model: `docs/SCALE_EVIDENCE.md`.
A synthetic 9-scale demo sheet ships in `examples/synthetic_scaleup/`.

## Install / run

The core install is **torch-free**: `numpy` / `pandas` / `scikit-learn` / `scipy`
only, enough to use `kalos.kit` (leakage-controlled splits, signed Spearman
drivers, split-conformal intervals, promotion gates, the anonymizer). The GP
surrogate, acquisition, and grouped-CV evaluation need the `ml` extra
(torch / botorch / gpytorch).

```bash
python -m pip install -e .              # core, torch-free (kalos.kit primitives only)
python -m pip install -e ".[ml]"        # + the BoTorch engine (surrogate, optimize, evaluation)
python -m pip install -e ".[protein]"   # + real ESM-2 (transformers)

python examples/run_bo_loop.py          # BoTorch closed-loop demo (needs [ml])
python examples/run_multiobjective.py   # multi-objective (titer + purity) Pareto demo (needs [ml])
python examples/run_protein_embed.py    # ESM-2 embedding demo (downloads a small model)
python -m pytest                        # tests (KALOS_TEST_ESM=1 to include ESM-2)

python -m pip install -e ".[ml,portal]" # the web portal (FastAPI) drives the live GP, so it needs [ml] too
python -m kalos.portal                # -> http://127.0.0.1:8050  (live BO + Pareto view)
```

### Development checks

CI runs the same three gates on every push and pull request (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
Reproduce them from a clean `.[ml,portal,dev]` install:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[ml,portal,dev]"  # + ruff, mypy, and type stubs
ruff check kalos/                            # lint
mypy                                          # types (config in pyproject [tool.mypy])
python -m pytest -q                           # tests
```

## Device

BoTorch GPs run in float64 for numerical stability, and Apple's MPS backend is
float32-only, so the **GP runs on CPU** (fast for the small-sample regime BO
targets). The **ESM-2 embedder runs on MPS** when available. No GPU is required
to use the platform locally.

## Domains: reusing the engine beyond bioprocess

The optimization engine (`core/`), the experiment store (`store/`), the runner
(`runner/`), and the upload/validate pipeline are domain-neutral: they operate on
numeric arrays and know nothing about biology. Biology lives in the `domains/`
layer as data, not code in the engine.

- **Declared column roles.** By default the analyze path infers roles (target,
  features, ids, group) from the bioprocess profile's name hints. A caller in any
  other domain can instead declare a `ColumnRoles` schema (target, features,
  categoricals, groups, ids) so they state what their columns mean rather than
  renaming them to match a regex. `POST /api/run` accepts an optional `roles`
  JSON field for this; with it the analysis runs under the neutral generic
  profile.
- **Mixed continuous + categorical design spaces.** A `DesignSpace` marks each
  dimension continuous or categorical. When categoricals are present the engine
  fits a BoTorch `MixedSingleTaskGP` and proposes with `optimize_acqf_mixed`, and
  proposals decode integer level codes back to labels. The continuous-only path
  is unchanged.

To target a new domain: declare a `ColumnRoles` (or copy `domains/generic.py`
into a new profile) and, if it has discrete choices, list them under
`categoricals`. Nothing in `core/` changes. The `mixed_bump` objective in
`bench/` exercises the mixed loop end to end.

## Roadmap

- ~~Multi-objective (qNEHVI) for titer + purity together.~~ **Done** (`core/multiobjective.py`).
- ~~Mixed continuous/categorical inputs (carbon source, medium) via BoTorch.~~ **Done**
  (`domains/`, `core` mixed GP + `optimize_acqf_mixed`); large categorical spaces fall
  back to `optimize_acqf_mixed_alternating`.
- The push-feed ingestion loop (platform streams runs in; brain proposes the next
  batch; anonymized on read).
- ~~Feasibility classifier + gated acquisition.~~ **Done** (`core/feasibility.py`,
  `bo_feas` / `bo_feas_clean` strategies in `bench/pool.py`).
- ~~Calibration (ECE) for the promotion gates.~~ **Done**
  (`core/evaluation.py::interval_calibration`, reported as `reliability.calibration`).
- ~~Wire `check_gates` into the analysis path.~~ **Done**
  (`core/feasibility.py::feasibility_cv_report` supplies AUC/Brier/classifier-ECE;
  `_analyze` reports the fail-closed verdict as the top-level `promotion` block.
  Reported, never enforced: the verdict cannot reject an upload.)
- ~~Replicate-aware aggregation + assay noise-floor estimation + optional
  fixed-noise GP.~~ **Done** (`core/replicates.py`, `Surrogate.fit(..., noise=...)`,
  `pool_from_frame(..., aggregate=True)`) — the SNR lever from `BENCHMARK.md`.
- Larger ESM-2 / full NVIDIA BioNeMo backend behind the same embedder interface.

No proprietary data lives in this repo; the demos use synthetic data and public
protein sequences.
